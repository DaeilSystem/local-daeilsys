      "title": "Feedback & Feedforward Control Algorithm",
      "description": "The DVIA series uses the Feedback control algorithm to continuously detect vibrations disturbing an isolated surface and instantaneously react to minimize the vibrations in real-time. The Feed-Forward control algorithm is employed in the DVIA Series to filter out floor vibrations in advance before the floor vibrations can be transmitted to equipment installed on the active vibration isolation systems.",
